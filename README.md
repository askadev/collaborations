# Collaborative Projects

Group projects, but better. These projects are created and developed in the open. Contributors are encouraged to hack away during downtime at a meetup, to tackle an open feature with a mentor or mentee, or to fly solo and make your own contributions.

## Philosophy

Anyone can contribute, anyone can learn, everyone should work together. Every project will be developed in the open following published specs.  Collaborative projects are teaching opportunities and a way for the international Ask a Dev community to connect.

## Proposing a Project

Make a PR to this repo from the following information:

[ ] Name
[ ] Short description
[ ] Three initial specs
[ ] Primary stack
[ ] A clear, achievable goal for v1

Epic projects should be broken up into smaller projects (think microservices).

A new repo will be made if approved, and you'll be given RW permissions.

## Responsibility

By submitting a proposal, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to maintain the project and reasonably respond (promptly, politely) to pull requests, issues and community requests. This is not a blood oath; you can leave the project at any time (please appoint a new maintainer or maintainers).

You also agree to follow Ask a Dev's [code of conduct](https://github.com/askadev/community-standards#code-of-conduct). Violations of the code of conduct will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, but Ask a Dev reserves the right to remove you from the project (or transfer it away from our org to your personal Github).

## Ownership

The project will be promoted within the Ask a Dev network and will be featured here. You may use whatever license you deem appropriate. If you hit the big time with a project, we ask that you respect the community (for example, leave existing open source work in the open) and the license used by the project. Don't forget about us little people.

## Resources

We're actively seeking funds to provide necessary resources (for example, a paid AWS mail server). This will be assessed on a project-by-project basis and by how much money we have in the bank (about $12 on a good day). Benefactors, please reach out at sponsor [at] ask a dev dot org.
